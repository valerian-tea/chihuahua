title: FallbackExample
---
Alice: In this example if no option is chosen before time runs out we chose the option with the fallback metadata.
Alice: This differs from the default example as the fallback option is hidden from the user.

-> Option 1?
    Alice: option 1 was selected
-> Option 2?
    Alice: option 2 was selected
-> Option 3? #fallback
    Alice: The hidden fallback option was selected

title: DefaultExample
---
Alice: In this example if no option is chosen before time runs out we chose the option with the default metadata.
Alice: this differs from the fallback example as the default is visible to the user.

-> Option 1? #default
    Alice: option 1 was selected
    Alice: this is the default.
-> Option 2?
    Alice: option 2 was selected

title: LastHighlightExample
---
Alice: In this example if no option is selected the last option that is highlighted will be selected.
Alice: Unlike the default or fallback approaches this one requires a command to toggle the mode, but needs no metadata.

<<auto_opt>>
-> Option 1?
    Alice: option 1 was selected
-> Option 2?
    Alice: option 2 was selected
