Alice: Hey what's up?

Player: Just wondering what this demo is about.
Alice: It's showing off how you can do events with markup now.
Player: Oh? How does it work?
Alice: Easy, you just do it now with [link="docs.yarnspinner.dev/yarn-spinner-for-unity/samples/inline-events" external=true]ActionMarkupHandler's[/link].
Player: So what, just part way through I stop talking... [move name="far" /] ...and move on over?
Alice: Yeah you did

// move back
Player: hang on a second
<<move near>>
Player: is it just for movement?

Alice: nope you can use it for practically any...
Player: like changing emotions?!
Alice: Yes... which I would have shown had [b]you[emotion="angry" /] [/b] not interrupted me.
Player: oh sorry
Alice: [i]sigh[/i] [emotion="neutral" /]it's ok.
Alice: Checkout out the [b]Event Handlers[/b] in this scene to see how they work.
Alice: There are two, [link="db64840ec0c36401f873b24dff0af213"]Move Event[/link] and [link="2fbf06e014a6c439db5d81b0ca68b128"]Emotion Event[/link].
