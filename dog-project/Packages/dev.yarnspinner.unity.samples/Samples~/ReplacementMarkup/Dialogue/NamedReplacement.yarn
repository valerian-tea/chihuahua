Alice: Hey there [name]Player[/name].
Player: Hey there [name]Alice[/name], what up?
Alice: I show off how you can use markup to flag important elements based on contents.
Player: oh?
Alice: yes, so for example I am just wondering what [name]Bob[/name] is up to.
Bob: Why are [name=alice]you[/name] wondering what [name=bob]I[/name] am up to?
Player: I think [name=alice]she's[/name] just being nice [name]Bob[/name]!
Bob: oh, ok.
